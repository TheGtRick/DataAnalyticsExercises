I have a bear
And her name is Sue
She can do anything that I can do
I can do anything that she can do.
In the morning I stretch and Sue does her best
I put on trousers and a shirt and Sue wears a skirt
On with my socks and on with my shoes
And on goes the same for dear old Sue
And we're ready for breakfast in the twinkling of an eye
So we go downstairs my Sue and I
